6.813 Spring 2014 Web Application - Surreal Estate

Surreal Estate is a web application developed for people interested in finding a neighborhood that matches their needs and preferences. Users looking to find a neighborhood with a good fit first take a survey to gain an understanding on what their needs and interests. The website then allows them to explore the aggregated crowdsourced information and ratings on nearby neighborhoods and also uses the collected data to give recommendations to them based on user preferences.
